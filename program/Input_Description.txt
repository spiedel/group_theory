This file describes the formatting for the input to grid_input.

The files will contain a list of numbers which will have a certain given structure as seen underneath.
This structure is implemented using a GUI that will put the numbers into a file.

For a circle;
[1,r,x_0,y_0,V]

r=radius
(x_0,y_0)=centre of circle
V=potential on circle

For a line;
[2,x_0,y_0,x_n,y_n,V]

(x_0,y_0)=starting coordinate
(x_n,y_n)=end coordinate
V=potential on line

For a rectangle;
[3,x_0,y_0,dx,dy,V]

(x_0,y_0)=left-hend upper corner
dx=x-sidelenght
dy=y-sidelenght
V=potential on rectangle
